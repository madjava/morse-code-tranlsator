# Morse Code Translator

This small project was built just for fun. It takes in text input from the user and converts it to morse code. If it can't process the input it prints out an error message instead.

## Setup

After checking out or downloading the project, run

```bash
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, start the application by running

```bash
npm start
```

## Tests

To run all test suites run

```bash
npm test
```
